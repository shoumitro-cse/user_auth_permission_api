### User authentication permission applicaion

A user auth permission application has been built using Python, Custom Token, 
Django, Django rest framework, and drf_spectacular package for API docs. 
Here,  have 3 types of user roles like Admin, Staff, General and 
admin can set user table data access permission through api for Staff users.
admin also can set permissions for staff, who can access (for CRUD operation) 
user table specific columns via API. Staff users access user table data by API
based on their permissions.(for CRUD operation).

### API docs

```
Here, It has been used as a drf_spectacular package for API docs, I think that it will be 
very helpful for frontend developers. If you would like to see special instructions for 
each api, please keep your eye on each API doc.
protocol = http, https
domain = localhost or others
port = 80, 8000 etc
{protocol}://{domain}:{port}/api/docs/ (for API HTTP methods and descriptions)
{protocol}://{domain}:{port}/api/redocs/
{protocol}://{domain}:{port}/api/schema/ (for download API ymal file)
```
